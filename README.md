## NameMC-API
Java wrapper for the popular Minecraft related site: https://namemc.com

### Purposes of this project
Basically, this API doesn't support much (but everything it actually can due to lack of API from NameMC creators).

What are the purposes of this API? Well, you can reward players on your Minecraft server that have liked your server on the NameMC. Besides that, you can easily handle friends of your players and add some interactaction between them, like every 5 new friends on the NameMC, player will receive 5 diamonds and so on.

### Requirements
All you need is Java 8 and optionally Maven if you don't want to download sources on your own.

### How to use (Maven)
You need to add repository to your project's pom.xml:
```xml
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>jaqobb-repo</id>
		<url>https://repo.jaqobb.co/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
```
and add dependency:
```xml
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>co.jaqobb</groupId>
		<artifactId>namemc-api</artifactId>
		<version>1.1.9-SNAPSHOT</version>
		<scope>compile</scope>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```
Yeah, you actually need to compile this library if you are using Maven due to it's not shaded anywhere by default.

### How to use (No Maven)
You need to download the sources and add them to your code. This project is depedency free so you wouldn't have to install more libraries.

### API
Everythings begins with the class NameMC. You can either use preset settings created by me, or experiment with settings numbers on your own:
```java
NameMC.ofDefault();
```
to create a new instance of NameMC class with default settings, or:
```java
NameMC.ofCustom(ProfileService profileService, ServerService serverService);
```
to create a new instance of NameMC class with custom settings.

But what the hell is profile and server service? They are being used to store cached profiles and servers and give you possibility to lookup a new ones.

At this moment you are able to only change time between which cached profiles and servers don't need to be recached again.

You use both the profile and the server service in the same way.

You create profile service with either:
```java
ProfileService.ofDefault();
```
to create profile service with default values being 5 as a time and minutes as a unit, or:
```java
ProfileService.ofCustom(long time, TimeUnit unit);
```
to create profile service with custom time and unit.

The same thing goes for the server service, just replace "Profile" with "Server".

When you created NameMC class instance, you can now use profile service to lookup a profile:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().getProfile(UUID uniqueId, boolean recache, BiConsumer<Profile, Exception> callback);
```
Unique id is the unique id of the profile you want to lookup.
Recache defines if the profile should be forced to be recached even if there is already a cached profile with the given unique id and if the cache time was smaller than store time.
Callback returns you a profile filled with all information that could possibly be get about the profile (unique id of this profile, all friends and the time this profile was cached at) and exception which is null if the error didn't occur when trying to lookup the profile.

When you have your profile ready, you can access some nice methods:
```java
// Returns unique id of the profile.
getUniqueId();

// Returns an immutable collection of friends.
// In a Friend class, you can use getUniqueId() to get friend's unique id, getName() to get friend's name, getCacheTime() to get time this friend instance was cached at, isFriendOf(Profile profile) or isFriendOf(Profile profile, boolean caseSensitive) to check the friend is on the given profile's friend list, or hasLiked(Server server) to check if the friend has liked the given server.
getFriends();

// Returns friend with the given unique id, or null if the profile doesn't have a friend with the given unique id.
getFriend(UUID uniqueId);

// Returns friend with the given name (case sensitive), or null if the profile doesn't have a friend with the given name.
getFriend(String name);

// Returns friend with the given name (case sensitive or not), or null if the profile doesn't have a friend with the given name.
getFriend(String name, boolean caseSensitive);

// Returns true if the profile has a friend with the given unique id, false otherwise.
hasFriend(UUID uniqueId);

// Returns true if the profile has a friend with the given name (case sensitive), false otherwise.
hasFriend(String name);

// Returns true if the profile has a friend with the given name (case sensitive or not), false otherwise.
hasFriend(String name, boolean caseSensitive);

// Returns time the profile was cached at.
getCacheTime();

// Returns true, if the profile has liked the given server, false otherwise.
hasLiked(Server server);
```

You can also use server service to lookup a server:
```java
nameMC.getServerService().getServer(String ip, boolean recache, BiConsumer<Server, Exception> callback);
```
Ip is the ip of the server you want to lookup (case insensitive).
Recache defines if the server should be forced to be recached even if there is already a cached server with the given ip and if the cache time was smaller than store time.
Callback returns you a server filled with all information that could possibly be get about the server (ip of this server, all unique ids that have liked this server and the time this server was cached at) and exception which is null if the error didn't occur when trying to lookup the server.

When you have your server ready, you can access some nice methods:
```java
// Returns ip of the server.
getIp();

// Returns an immutable collection of unique ids that have liked the server.
getLikes();

// Returns true if the given unique id has liked the server, false otherwise.
hasLiked(UUID uniqueId);

// Returns time the server was cached at.
getCacheTime();
```

You can also get all cached profiles and servers by using:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().getProfiles();
nameMC.getServerService().getServers();
```

Since version 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT you can also clear both caches at once by using:
```java
nameMC.clearCaches();
```
or one by one using:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().clearProfiles();
nameMC.getServerService().clearServers();
```

Since version 1.1.3-SNAPSHOT you are able to check if profile or server is valid. Being valid means so profile or server is not null, and doesn't need to be recached:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().isProfileValid(Profile profile);
nameMC.getServerService().isServerValid(Server server);
```

That's all! Thank you for using NameMC-API!
