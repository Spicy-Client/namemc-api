## NameMC-API
Java wrapper for the popular Minecraft related site: https://namemc.com

### Purposes of this project
This project is supposed to give you easier access to the NameMC API.

### Requirements
All you need is Java 8 and optionally Maven if you don't want to download sources on your own.

### How to use (Maven)
You need to add repository to your project pom.xml file:
```xml
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>jaqobb-repo</id>
		<url>https://repo.jaqobb.co/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
```
and then add dependency:
```xml
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>co.jaqobb</groupId>
		<artifactId>namemc-api</artifactId>
		<version>1.2.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
		<scope>compile</scope>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```
You need to compile this library due to it's not shaded anywhere by default.

### How to use (No Maven)
Simply download source and add it to your current project and then do it the same with the org.json library.

### API
Everything begins with the NameMC class. You can either use preset settings created by me, or experiment with settings on your own:
```java
NameMC.of();
NameMC.of(ProfileService profileService, ServerService serverService);
```
Profile and server service are being used to store cached profiles and servers and give you possibility to lookup a new ones.

At this moment you are able to only change time between which cached profiles and servers don't need to be re-cached again.

You use both the profile and server service in the same way.

You create profile service with either:
```java
ProfileService.of();
```
to create profile service with default settings being 5 as a time and minutes as a unit, or:
```java
ProfileService.of(long time, TimeUnit durationUnit);
```
to create profile service with custom settings.

The same thing goes for the server service, just replace "Profile" with "Server".

When you created a new NameMC class instance, you can now use profile service to lookup a profile:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().getProfile(UUID uniqueId, boolean recache, BiConsumer<Profile, Exception> callback);
```
Unique id is the unique id of the profile you want to lookup.
Re-cache defines if the profile should be forced to be re-cached even if there is already a cached profile with the given unique id and if the cache time was smaller than the store time.
Callback returns you a profile filled with all information that could possibly be get about the profile (unique id of this profile, all friends and so on) and exception which is null if the error didn't occur when trying to lookup the profile.

When you have your profile ready, you can access some nice methods:
```java
// Returns unique id of the profile.
getUniqueId();

// Returns an immutable collection of friends.
// In a Friend class, you can use getUniqueId() to get friend's unique id, getName() to get friend's name, getCacheTime() to get time this friend instance was cached at, isFriendOf(Profile profile) or isFriendOf(Profile profile, boolean caseSensitive) to check the friend is on the given profile's friend list, or hasLiked(Server server) to check if the friend has liked the given server.
getFriends();

// Returns friend with the given unique id, or null if the profile doesn't have a friend with the given unique id.
getFriend(UUID uniqueId);

// Returns friend with the given name (case sensitive), or null if the profile doesn't have a friend with the given name.
getFriend(String name);

// Returns friend with the given name (case sensitive or not), or null if the profile doesn't have a friend with the given name.
getFriend(String name, boolean caseSensitive);

// Returns true if the profile has a friend with the given unique id, false otherwise.
hasFriend(UUID uniqueId);

// Returns true if the profile has a friend with the given name (case sensitive), false otherwise.
hasFriend(String name);

// Returns true if the profile has a friend with the given name (case sensitive or not), false otherwise.
hasFriend(String name, boolean caseSensitive);

// Returns time the profile was cached at.
getCacheTime();

// Returns true, if the profile has liked the given server, false otherwise.
hasLiked(Server server);
```

You can also use server service to lookup a server:
```java
nameMC.getServerService().getServer(String ip, boolean recache, BiConsumer<Server, Exception> callback);
```
Ip is the ip of the server you want to lookup (case insensitive).
Re-cache defines if the server should be forced to be re-cached even if there is already a cached server with the given ip and if the cache time was smaller than the store time.
Callback returns you a server filled with all information that could possibly be get about the server (ip of this server, all unique ids that have liked this server and so on) and exception which is null if the error didn't occur when trying to lookup the server.

When you have your server ready, you can access some nice methods:
```java
// Returns ip of the server.
getIp();

// Returns an immutable collection of unique ids that have liked the server.
getLikes();

// Returns true if the given unique id has liked the server, false otherwise.
hasLiked(UUID uniqueId);

// Returns time the server was cached at.
getCacheTime();
```

You can also get all cached profiles and servers by using:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().getProfiles();
nameMC.getServerService().getServers();
```

Since the 1.1.1-SNAPSHOT version you can also clear both caches at once by using:
```java
nameMC.clearCaches();
```
or one by one using:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().clearProfiles();
nameMC.getServerService().clearServers();
```

Since the 1.1.3-SNAPSHOT version you are able to check if profile or server is valid. Being valid means so profile or server is not null, and doesn't need to be re-cached:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().isProfileValid(Profile profile);
nameMC.getServerService().isServerValid(Server server);
```

Since the 1.2-SNAPSHOT version you are able to get all valid or invalid profiles/servers by using:
```java
nameMC.getProfileService().getValidProfiles();
nameMC.getProfileService().getInvalidProfiles();

nameMC.getServerService().getValidServers();
nameMC.getServerService().getInvalidServers();
```

That's all! Thank you for using NameMC-API!
